    "Senior Software Engineer", "Allianz Global Investors - Munich, Germany", "03/2023 - 05/2024",
    "[Python, C#]: I wrote C# core libraries to simulate the performance of trading strategies for options & derivatives, as well as Python packages to orchestrate scenario simulations, interact with diverse data systems over REST, with SQL Databases, etc. I collaborated closely with quantitative researchers and financial engineers to ship our product. I learned about financial mathematics, portfolio management & risk modeling.",
    "Software Engineer", "Preisenergie GmbH - Munich, Germany", "03/2021 - 02/2023", "[Python, R, REST, PostgreSQL, Django, FastAPI, DDD, TDD]: Designed and built RESTful applications with Django and FastAPI to calculate contract prices for existing utility customers. Rearchitected and refactored a large untested legacy codebase towards a Domain-Driven-Design based on R packages with a clear separation of concerns. Designed, implemented and tested a price optimization algorithm using Quadratic Programming with ~10⁵ variables. Improved expected CLV over the existing algorithm by 20\\% on average. Extended a web application to manage and analyze data on energy contracts. Translated the product roadmap into a system design, onboarded new developers, performed 1on1s, code reviews & retrospective meetings.",
    "Software Engineering Intern - Core Machine Learning", "Amazon - Berlin, Germany", "09/2017 - 02/2018", "[Java, AWS]: Wrote a tool to benchmark cutting-edge Multiarmed-Bandits models for product recommendation. I released it on AWS, so that all internal development teams in Amazon and AWS could asses the potential revenue increases based on their own datasets.",
    "Bachelor's Thesis", "BMW Group - Munich, Germany", "03/2017 - 08/2017", "[Python, Spark, Hadoop, Tableau]: Evaluated the query latency, throughput, and DB consistency of an application that monitored the engine manufacturing process."
