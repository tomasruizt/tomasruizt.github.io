# Summary

Research Assistant at LMU Munich at the intersection of Machine Learning and Multi-modal AI.
My current work focuses on efficient and scalable inference for large language and vision-language models.
I am the author of a paper on test-time scaling accepted at EMNLP 2025 and an active contributor to vLLM, where I implemented speculative decoding with significant throughput improvements. Previously, I worked as a software engineer building scalable systems in industry.
