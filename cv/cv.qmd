### Summary

I am an NLP researcher (PhD student) at the LMU University in Munich (Germany) working on LLM inference and GPU performance engineering.
Before that I worked as a full-time software engineer in different companies and start-ups.
I am active in Open Source, concretely in the vLLM project.
Now I am looking for an internship where I can contribute to optimize inference and training systems.
