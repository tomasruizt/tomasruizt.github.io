* Unit tests are great, but often don't capture the full picture
* You need quick access to your sanity-check evaluation suite
* These scripts should live outside the git repository to avoid being wiped.
* Long lived branches can experience a lot of merge conflicts.
* Show example of `Eagle.propose()` method.
* Its not always clear whom to ask for a review and who can actually accept your PR.
