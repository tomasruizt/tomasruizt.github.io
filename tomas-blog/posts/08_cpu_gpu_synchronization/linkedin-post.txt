**New post: PyTorch and CPU–GPU Synchronizations (Writing Fast PyTorch Code) 🚀**

PyTorch GPU execution is mostly asynchronous. Performance issues often come from implicit CPU-GPU synchronizations: In this case, the CPU becomes blocked and stops scheduling new PyTorch operations for the GPU.

In this post I cover:
* What syncs look like in Nsight Systems: long CPU-side CUDA API calls like `cudaStreamSynchronize`, or blocking device-to-host transfers.
* Subtle sync triggers in real code: Dynamic-shape patterns where output sizes depend on GPU data (e.g. boolean indexing / data-dependent slicing).
* How to unit test for syncs: `torch.cuda.set_sync_debug_mode()` to surface sync points as warnings/errors in tests.
