## Background

The paper _Cut Your Losses in Large-Vocabulary Language Models_ by @wijmans2025cut presents a method to massively reduce the VRAM footprint of training LLMs.
The key idea is to avoid materializing the full logits during the loss computation.
Instead, they compute the loss incrementally on SRAM.
They report reducing the memory footprint computing the cross-entropy loss for Gemma 2 (2B) from 24GB to 1MB on a batch of size 8,192.

This made me wonder: 
Can we use this technique to reduce the VRAM footprint of inference on LLMs?
There is an important difference between training and inference.
During training, we never sample from the distribution given by the logits.
Instead, a method called teacher-forcing is used:
The logits are compared to the ground truth and the loss is computed by the cross-entropy loss function.
In constrast, during inference, the logits must be converted into a distribution, e.g. using the softmax function,
and then sampled from.

The kernels in [Liger Kernel](https://github.com/linkedin/Liger-Kernel) by @hsu2025ligerkernelefficienttriton are also aimed at training-time, and include no sampling primitives.
The [FlashInfer](https://github.com/flashinfer-ai/flashinfer) library by @ye2025flashinfer is aimed at inference, but all the sampling kernels take `logits` or `probs` as input, which means that you still need to materialize full logits in VRAM before calling them. Below are two examples of the FlashInfer [sampling API](https://docs.flashinfer.ai/api/sampling.html) for reference.

```python
# Sampling method taking probs
sampling_from_probs(probs: Tensor, ...) -> Tensor

# Sampling method taking logits
top_k_top_p_sampling_from_logits(logits: Tensor, ...) -> Tensor
```

While FlashInfer is the backbone of inference engines like vLLM [@DBLP:conf/sosp/KwonLZ0ZY0ZS23], or SGLang [@zheng2024sglang],
it still assumed that logits must be materialized in VRAM.
But I was looking for a method that incrementally computed the logits and sampled from them in a single pass.
I knew that incrementally computing the softmax is possible, as described by @milakov2018onlinenormalizercalculationsoftmax (_online-softmax_).
However, they still materialize the full probabilities in VRAM.
The online-softmax method is also used in _FlashAttention_ [@dao2022flashattention], but they never sample from the probabilities,
because they are used in attention, rather than in the language modeling (LM) head.
All the building blocks exist (online-softmax, incremental logit computation), but have never been put together in a single method for efficient sampling. I set out to implement this myself.

# Note
I later found the paper **FlashSample**, which presents a conceptually similar algorithm [@qin2025flashsampling].
The paper was submitted to ICLR 25, but it was rejected due to a weak justification and experimental evidence.
In this post I present comprehensive experimental results, compare the method against the best baselines for LLM sampling, and dive deep into the real bottlenecks of LLM sampling.
:::

## Overview
Let's restate the goals:

* We want to sample from the probability determined by the logits of the LM head
* We want to avoid materializing the full logits in VRAM

This means that the inputs of the kernel are the hidden states $H$ of the last hidden layer and last position, and the weights $W$ of the LM head.
Multiplying them yield the logits $L$, from which the probabilities $P$ are computed using the softmax. The sizes are as follows:

* $W$ has shape $(V, d)$, where $V$ is the vocabulary size and $d$ is the hidden dimension
* $H$ has shape $(d, N)$, where $N$ is the number of hidden states. E.g. during batched inference, $N$ is the batch size.
* $L$ has shape $(V, N)$
* $P$ has shape $(V, N)$

Generally speaking, the largest among these is the vocabulary size $V$, which can range up to 256k, followed by the hidden dimension $d$, which be around 8k, and finally the batch size $N$, which can be 256 in batched inference.

Below is a simple PyTorch function that implements the sampling by computing the logits and probabilities.
This is just to get an idea of the steps involved, but we want to avoid computing the logits in full.
For simplicity, I'm sampling a single sample, and not applying any temperature scaling.

```python
def sample(
    weights: torch.Tensor,       # [V, d]
    hidden_states: torch.Tensor, # [N, d]
):
    logits = hidden_states @ weights.T  # [N, V]
    probs = logits.softmax(dim=-1)      # [N, V]
    samples = torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1)
    return samples  # [N, 1]
```

## Tiling the Computation
To break down the computation into an incremental fashion, I used Triton, which supports tiling the computation.
The logits are the result of a matrix multiplication, which can be tiled in across the $V$, $d$, and $H$ dimensions as shown in @fig-tiled-mm.
The tiles of $W$ have shape $(T_V, T_d)$ while the tiles of $H$ have shape $(T_d, T_N)$.
The resulting tiles of the logits have shape $(T_V, T_N)$.

![Tiling the computation of the logits.](imgs/Fused%20MM%20sample.png){width="80%" text-align="left" fig-alt="Tiling the computation of the logits" .lightbox #fig-tiled-mm}

## Incremental Sampling

The next part of the puzzle is how to incrementally sample based on a single tile of logits, rather than on the full vector of logits.
The problem is not strictly the softmax normalization factor, which can be computed incrementally (online-softmax).
Rather, the problem is that we don't know how likely each token is in comparison to the others until we have computed the last (bottom) tile of logits.

To understand this, consider the logits case below, where the vocabulary size $V=8$, the tile size $T_V=2$ (so, 8/2 = 4 tiles).
The horizontal lines separate the tiles.
Notice how its impossible to know and sample from the highest probability logit (50.0) until the last tile is computed.

$$
\begin{aligned}
L &= \begin{bmatrix}
1.0 \\
1.2 \\
\hline
2.0 \\
1.4 \\
\hline
1.0 \\
2.1 \\
\hline
1.1 \\
50.0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

However, there is one statistical trick to circumvent this problem: The Gumbel-Max trick.

## Gumbel-Max Trick

The Gumbel-max trick lets us sample from a categorical distribution using only logits, completely bypassing the softmax function. The key identity is:

$$
\text{argmax}_i \left( \log \pi_i + G_i \right) \sim \text{Categorical}(\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_V)
$$

where $G_i \sim \text{Gumbel}(0, 1)$ are i.i.d. Gumbel random variables, and $\pi_i$ are the (unnormalized) probabilities.
Since logits are $\ell_i = \log \pi_i$ (up to a constant that cancels in the argmax), we can equivalently write:

$$
\text{sample} = \text{argmax}_i \left( \ell_i + G_i \right)
$$

A Gumbel(0,1) random variable can be generated from a uniform random variable $U \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 1)$ as $G = -\log(-\log(U))$.

### Why this is useful for tiled computation

The crucial property is that **argmax decomposes over tiles**. If we split the vocabulary into tiles $T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_K$, we can compute the local maximum in each tile independently:

$$
m_k = \max_{i \in T_k} \left( \ell_i + G_i \right), \quad a_k = \text{argmax}_{i \in T_k} \left( \ell_i + G_i \right)
$$

and then the global sample is simply:

$$
\text{sample} = a_{k^*} \quad \text{where} \quad k^* = \text{argmax}_k \, m_k
$$

Each tile only needs to output two values: its local max $m_k$ and the corresponding vocabulary index $a_k$. The full logit vector is never materialized -- each tile computes its logits, adds Gumbel noise, finds the local winner, and discards the rest. The final reduction over $K$ tiles is trivially cheap.

Compare this with the standard approach: softmax requires a full pass to compute the normalizer $Z = \sum_i e^{\ell_i}$, then another pass to compute probabilities, then sampling via inverse CDF. None of these operations decompose over tiles without cross-tile communication.

## Two-Stage Architecture

Putting the tiled matmul and the Gumbel-max trick together, the kernel has a two-stage design:

**Stage 1 (GPU kernel):** The Triton kernel launches a 2D grid of programs indexed by `(v, h)`, where `v` ranges over vocabulary tiles and `h` over batch tiles. Each program:

1. Computes its tile of logits via the tiled matmul: `logits_blk = W_tile @ H_tile.T`
2. Scales by temperature: `logits_blk /= temperature`
3. Generates Gumbel noise and adds it to the logits
4. Finds the local maximum and argmax over the vocabulary dimension
5. Writes the local max value and the corresponding global vocabulary index to main memory

Each program outputs just two values per hidden state: the local max and its index. The intermediate output is a tensor of shape `[num_V_tiles, N, num_samples]`.

**Stage 2 (host-side reduction):** A simple PyTorch reduction finds which tile had the global maximum for each hidden state, then gathers the corresponding vocabulary index:

```python
best_tiles = tile_maxs.argmax(dim=0)   # which tile won?
samples = tile_indices.gather(0, best_tiles)  # what index did it have?
```

This stage operates on `num_V_tiles` elements per hidden state (e.g. 512 tiles for V=128K with a tile size of 256) and is negligibly cheap compared to stage 1.

## Profiling

NVIDIA Nsight Compute (NCU) was invaluable for identifying optimization opportunities. The profiler provides detailed metrics on warp stalls, memory utilization, and cache behavior. Here are the key insights it surfaced:

**Warp stalls and memory access patterns.** The initial version showed significant warp stalls due to suboptimal memory access. NCU suggested looking for opportunities to improve memory access patterns, which led me to transpose the hidden states for coalesced reads. However, this change had only a marginal effect.

**Increasing tile size for data reuse.** A much better improvement was to increase the tile size along the batch dimension ($T_N$) from 4 to 32. This means each tile of weights is reused 8x more often to compute logits, directly improving the arithmetic intensity. This is a classic compute-vs-memory optimization: at small batch sizes the kernel is memory-bound, so making each weight load do more useful work is the primary lever.

**Shared memory bank conflicts.** The profiler also flagged bank conflicts when storing data to shared memory. In CUDA, this is relatively easy to fix by padding the shared memory array by +1 element per row, breaking the stride alignment. In Triton, we don't have direct control over shared memory layout, so I left this optimization on the table.

## Swizzling Bug

The Triton documentation for matrix multiplication suggests to swizzle the program ids to improve the data reuse. @fig-loading-blocks-in-grouped-order shows the difference between loading data blocks in row-major order vs loading them in a "grouped" order.
The expected benefit of this optimization is a "more than 10%" speedup in the matmul performance. 
The reason is that tiles of data are not loaded from VRAM but rather from the faster L2 cache.

![Loading Blocks in Grouped Order. Source: [Triton Docs](https://triton-lang.org/main/getting-started/tutorials/03-matrix-multiplication.html#l2-cache-optimizations)](imgs/grouped_vs_row_major_ordering.png){width="80%" text-align="left" fig-alt="Loading Blocks in Grouped Order" .lightbox #fig-loading-blocks-in-grouped-order}

I implemented this optimization with the existing Triton function `triton.language.swizzle_2d` ([docs](https://triton-lang.org/main/python-api/generated/triton.language.swizzle2d.html)), and saw speed increase massively. The Nsight Compute profiler showed that the L2 cache utilization increased from 50% to 90%, a steep jump.

However, I had made a mistake and passed wrong arguments to `swizzle_2d`.
This resulted in the same tiles being reloaded again and again, destroying the correctness of the computation, and explaning the excessive L2 cache utilization.
This bug was nevertheless difficult to catch, because the output of the kernel is a stochastic sample, rather than a deterministic result.
What made me suspicious was that my kernel, which includes a matmul, was 2x faster than the cuBLAS matmul, which should be close to optimal.
The performance was _too good to be true_, so I dug deeper and found the bug.

## Performance

I compare the performance of FMMS against strong baselines in LLM sampling. All benchmarks use the "large" configuration (V=128,256, d=8,192), representative of Llama 3 70B.

### Baselines

Both FlashInfer kernels require the full logits, so I include in their runtime the matmul to compute the logits. This is a fair comparison because FMMS also computes a matmul -- the logits are just never written to VRAM.

(1) **Naive PyTorch Compiled**: `torch.compile`-d matmul + softmax + `torch.multinomial`.
(2) **FlashInfer `top_k_top_p_sampling_from_logits`**: A dual-pivot rejection sampling kernel used in vLLM for top-k/top-p sampling.
(3) **FlashInfer `sampling_from_logits`**: FlashInfer's fastest sampling kernel. It also uses the Gumbel-max trick internally, but operates on pre-materialized logits.

A clear pattern emerges: **FMMS is 5-15% faster at small batch sizes (N=1 to 64) but regresses at large batch sizes (N=128+)**. The crossover point varies by GPU, but is consistently in the N=64--128 range.

### Why the Crossover? Arithmetic Intensity

The explanation lies in the **arithmetic intensity** of the matmul. The matmul $W_{[V, d]} \times H_{[N, d]}^T$ has:

$$
\text{Arithmetic Intensity} = \frac{\text{FLOPs}}{\text{Bytes}} = \frac{2 \cdot V \cdot d \cdot N}{2 \cdot V \cdot d} = N
$$

The weight matrix $W$ dominates the memory traffic ($V \cdot d$ elements, each read once), and the hidden states are negligible when $N \ll V$. So the arithmetic intensity is simply $N$: each byte of weights loaded produces $N$ multiply-adds.

A GPU becomes compute-bound when the arithmetic intensity exceeds its **ops:byte ratio** (peak compute / peak memory bandwidth). For the H100:

$$
\text{ops:byte} = \frac{989 \text{ TFLOP/s (BF16)}}{3.35 \text{ TB/s (HBM3)}} \approx 295
$$

| Batch size $N$ | Arithmetic intensity | Regime on H100 |
| -------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| 1              | 1                    | Deeply memory-bound (295x below threshold) |
| 32             | 32                   | Memory-bound (9x below) |
| 64             | 64                   | Memory-bound (5x below) |
| 295            | 295                  | Crossover to compute-bound |

**When memory-bound (N < ~128)**, the kernel's throughput is determined by how fast it reads the weight matrix from HBM. FMMS wins here because it reads the weights **once** and performs both the matmul and sampling in-kernel. The unfused baselines read the weights for the matmul, write logits to HBM, then read them back for sampling -- this extra round-trip wastes bandwidth on the bottleneck path.

**When compute-bound (N > ~128)**, the matmul dominates runtime and the cost of the extra HBM traffic for logits becomes negligible relative to the computation. The baselines can use highly optimized matmul implementations (cuBLAS via `torch.compile`), while FMMS carries the overhead of Gumbel noise generation and the max-reduction fused into the same kernel.

## Correctness

FMMS uses the Gumbel-max trick, which produces **exact** samples from the categorical distribution -- it is not an approximation. To verify this, I use a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test that compares 10,000 empirical samples against the theoretical softmax probabilities. The test is parametrized over multiple vocabulary sizes and batch sizes to catch tile-boundary edge cases.

One subtlety: `torch.multinomial` (used in the naive baseline) produces incorrect distributions when given bfloat16 probabilities. The internal CDF accumulation loses precision with bfloat16's 7-bit mantissa. The fix is to upcast to float32 before softmax: `probs = (logits.float() / temperature).softmax(dim=-1)`. This is a real bug that affects production code -- PyTorch's documentation does not mention this precision requirement.

## Conclusion

FMMS demonstrates that fusing matrix multiplication with sampling via the Gumbel-max trick is both correct and practical. The kernel is 5-15% faster than the best baselines at the batch sizes that matter most for LLM decode (N=1 to 64), where the operation is memory-bound and eliminating the extra HBM round-trip for logits directly improves throughput.

The approach has clear limitations: at large batch sizes where the matmul becomes compute-bound, unfused approaches with optimized matmul implementations (cuBLAS) are faster. This is a fundamental trade-off: fusion saves memory bandwidth at the cost of matmul efficiency.

The code is open-source and available at [github.com/tomasruizt/fused-mm-sample](https://github.com/tomasruizt/fused-mm-sample).
