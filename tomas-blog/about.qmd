# Tomas Ruiz

I am an NLP researcher (PhD student) at the LMU University in Munich (Germany), working on LLM inference and GPU performance engineering. Before this, I worked as a full-time software engineer in different companies and start-ups. I am active in Open Source, concretely in the vLLM project. You can find my full CV on LinkedIn.
